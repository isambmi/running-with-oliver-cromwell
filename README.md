This walkthrough is intended for use by the Deng's Bioinformatics Lab, but should be applicable to any environment where a **local** implementation of [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) server has been deployed.

## Dependencies

1. This walkthrough assumes that user and/or their environment has the following:
    - Conda: A new environment is highly recommended
    - [Oliver](https://stjudecloud.github.io/oliver/): Installing via `pip` is highly recommended, regardless of conda environment.
    - Access to the Arashi server, wrapper scripts are located at `/home/cromwell-scripts/`
